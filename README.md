# SimPy-Queuing-Simulation-
This is a discrete event simulation of a Jackson Queueing Network written in Python using the SimPy library for an assignment from my CS 350 Computer Systems Fundamentals class at Boston University. 
It involves packets switching between a CPU, network I/O, and disk I/O with different probabilities, or leaving the system entirely. Depending on how you comment code in or out, you can plot requests over time or print out various statistics. 
The assignment sheet with the description of the system parameters can be found [here] ()
